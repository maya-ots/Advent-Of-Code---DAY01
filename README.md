# Advent-Of-Code---DAY01
The challenge simulates a 100-position dial (0–99) rotated L/R by given amounts. Part 1 asks for the final position after all rotations and counts the amount of times we get 0 after each rotation. Part 2 (method 0x434C49434B) counts every time the dial passes through 0 during rotations and after rotations, using that count as the password.
